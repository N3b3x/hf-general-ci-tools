## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
- Check `help wanted` for more complex tasks
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Workflow Development Guidelines](#workflow-development-guidelines)
- Update documentation as needed
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 3. Test Your Changes

- Test workflows in a test repository
- Verify all inputs and outputs work correctly
- Check that error handling works as expected

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

- Follow the [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process)
- Ensure all checks pass
- Request review from maintainers

## Workflow Development Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Reusability**: Workflows should be designed for use across different repositories
- **Configurability**: Provide sensible defaults but allow extensive customization
- **Reliability**: Include proper error handling and validation
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and resource usage
- **Security**: Follow GitHub Actions security best practices

### Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Workflow Name
description: 'Brief description of what this workflow does'

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      # Define all inputs with descriptions
    outputs:
      # Define outputs if applicable
    secrets:
      # Define required secrets

jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step name
        # Implementation
```

### Input Guidelines

- **Use descriptive names**: `source_directories` instead of `dirs`
- **Provide clear descriptions**: Explain what each input does
- **Set sensible defaults**: Make workflows work out-of-the-box
- **Validate inputs**: Check for required values and valid formats
- **Use appropriate types**: `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `choice`

### Output Guidelines

- **Define meaningful outputs**: Only include outputs that other workflows might need
- **Use consistent naming**: Follow a clear naming convention
- **Document outputs**: Explain what each output contains

### Error Handling

- **Validate inputs early**: Check for required parameters and valid values
- **Provide clear error messages**: Help users understand what went wrong
- **Use appropriate exit codes**: Follow standard conventions
- **Include troubleshooting hints**: Suggest common solutions

### Security Considerations

- **Minimize permissions**: Only request necessary permissions
- **Use secrets appropriately**: Mark sensitive inputs as secrets
- **Avoid hardcoded values**: Use inputs and environment variables
- **Follow principle of least privilege**: Limit access to what's needed

## Documentation Guidelines

### Workflow Documentation

Each workflow should have:
- **Purpose**: What the workflow does
- **Inputs**: All available inputs with descriptions
- **Outputs**: All outputs with descriptions
- **Examples**: Basic and advanced usage examples
- **Prerequisites**: Required setup and configuration
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Documentation Structure

```markdown
# Workflow Name

Brief description of the workflow.

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| input1 | Description | Yes | value |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| output1 | Description |

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```yaml
# Example here
```

### Advanced Usage
```yaml
# Example here
```

## Prerequisites

- List prerequisites

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Issue 1: Solution
- Issue 2: Solution
```

### Code Comments

- **Explain complex logic**: Don't assume readers understand everything
- **Document non-obvious decisions**: Explain why certain choices were made
- **Include examples**: Show how to use complex features
- **Keep comments up-to-date**: Update comments when code changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Testing Your Workflows

1. **Create a test repository** with sample code
2. **Test all input combinations** you can think of
3. **Verify error handling** with invalid inputs
4. **Check performance** with large codebases
5. **Test on different platforms** if applicable

### Test Cases to Consider

- **Valid inputs**: Ensure workflows work with correct inputs
- **Invalid inputs**: Test error handling with bad inputs
- **Edge cases**: Test with empty inputs, very large inputs, etc.
- **Different environments**: Test on different operating systems
- **Integration**: Test workflows work together
